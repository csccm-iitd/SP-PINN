# 'Stochastic projection based approach for gradient free physics informedlearning '
The repository provides the python codes for the numerical examples illustrated in the paper ‘tochastic projection based approach for gradient free physics informed
learning’
Please go through the paper to understand the implemented algorithm.
Requirements:

1. Install python package pytorch, numpy, pandas, matplotlib etc.

2. The codes along with true solutions are provided in seperate folder for the five numerical examples. The files containing the codes are provided in the .ipynb format.    So, a jupyter notebook console is preferred.  

3. Add the data (True solutions) path use the run file to execute.
